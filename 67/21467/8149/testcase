Testcase for JMeter GUI problems.

W2K
jdk 1.4.1_05
jmeter 1.9.1

1.) Start with new Test Plan
2.) Create a Thread Group, T
3.) Add a Sampler, A, to T 
4.) Add a Sampler, B, to T
5.) Disable B, (This takes two trys)
6.) Enable B, (This may also take two trys, Exceptions should start flying)

Note:  If you find you way through the invisible menus and GUI screw ups and 
actually reactivate the Sampler the exceptions will stop.
