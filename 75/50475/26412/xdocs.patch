-The include controller is designed to use an external jmx file. To use it, add
-samples to a simple controller, then save the simple controller as a jmx file.
-The file can then be used in a test plan.
-The included test plan must not include a Thread Group.
-It should only contain the Simple Controller and any samplers, controllers etc below it.
+The include controller is designed to use an external jmx file. To use it, create a Test Fragment 
+underneath a Test Plan and add any desired samplers, controller etc below it.  Then save the Test Plan.  
+The file is now ready to be included as part of other Test Plans.

 <p>
+For convience purposes, a Thread Group can also be added in the external JMX file for debugging purposes.
+A Module Controller can be used to reference the Test Fragment.  The Thread Group will be ignored during the 
+include process.

+<p>
 If the test uses a Cookie Manager or User Defined Variables, these should be placed in the top-level
 test plan, not the included file, otherwise they are not guaranteed to work.
