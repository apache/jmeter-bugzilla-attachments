      You can configure <code>Duration (seconds)</code> and <code>Startup Delay (seconds)</code> to control
      the duration of each thread group and the after how much seconds it starts.
-     When the test is started, JMeter will wait <code>Startup Delay (seconds)</code> before starting the Threads

-     At the end of each cycle, JMeter checks if the end-time has been reached, and if so, the run is stopped,
