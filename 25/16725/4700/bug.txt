I misunderstood the original problem report.  The verbose output is to
the UI.  I had thought that it was to the JTL file.  The JTL file is
not verbose.

The previously attached test plan does demonstrate the verbose
output.  However, in some test plans that I had created, I did not get
verbose output.
