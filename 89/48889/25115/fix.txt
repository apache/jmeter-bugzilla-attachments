in StatisticalSampleResult:

change
    public static String getKey(SampleEvent event) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(80);
        sb.append(event.getResult().getSampleLabel()).append("-").append(event.getThreadGroup());
        return sb.toString();
    }

to

    public static String getKey(SampleEvent event) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(80);
        sb.append(event.getResult().getSampleLabel()).append("-").append(event.getResult().getThreadName());
        return sb.toString();
    }

Note: event.getThreadGroup is the same for all threads. This leads to the calculation of averages like

(max(endtime over all threads) - min(starttime over all threads) ) / number of samples. As most of the time all threads are running this leads to averages beeing to low by a factor of total number of threads.
